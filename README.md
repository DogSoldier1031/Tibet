Tibet

. (From the CIA) “The present population of Tibet 1s about 2,000,000. Of these 2,000,000. only about ten percent are pro-American and the majority of these are from the aristocratic, wealthy and religious claases. The other ninety percent are frionds or potential friends of the Mongolian People's Repudllc (MPR) and hope for Soviet ald. for the liberation and indevendence of Tibet.
2. The ruler of Tibet is the young I4th Dalad Lang who was born in Chinghal Province 25X1X
and shows pro-chinese tendencies, However, the Tibetan Governient is no longer subject to the wishes of the ruler. Conditions in Tibet are no longer a s they wareformerly when the Dalal Lamn held absolute dictatorial power in Tibet.”

“Until 1959, when China cracked down on Tibetan rebels and the Dalai Lama fled to northern India, around 98% of the population was enslaved in serfdom. Drepung monastery, on the outskirts of Lhasa, was one of the world's largest landowners with 185 manors, 25,000 serfs, 300 pastures, and 16,000 herdsmen. High-ranking lamas and secular landowners imposed crippling taxes, forced boys into monastic slavery and pilfered most of the country's wealth – torturing disobedient serfs by gouging out their eyes or severing their hamstrings.

Tashi Tsering, now an English professor at Lhasa University is representative of Tibetans that do not see China's occupation as worse tyranny. He was taken from his family near Drepung at 13 and forced into the Dalai Lama's personal dance troupe. Beaten by his teachers, Tsering put up with rape by a well-connected monk in exchange for protection. In his autobiography, The Struggle for Modern Tibet, Tsering writes that China brought long-awaited hope when is laid claim to Tibet in 1950.”

WESTERN PROPAGANDA
Tried to sell this while showing the Tibetan language on the blackboard and a Tibetan dictionary:

That failed, so they tried facing a new photo downward…and the student’s shirts & textbooks show Tibetan on them:

So now they crop out the book and blur the school uniform badge to remove all evidence of Tibetans being taught in their own language:

The Renminbi note has multiple languages on it, including Chinese (phonetic), Tibetan, Uighur, Mongolian & Zhuang.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_groups_in_China

There are 56 recognized ethnic groups, most with their own autonomous regions.  Tibet is one.  Tibet’s population density is 3 people per square kilometer.  If not boarding school, how will a developing nation have a schooling system that covers those children?  A million tiny schools? Only home schooling in a developing region that is only now overcoming generational illiteracy?  If they were left uneducated that would be considered abuse too.  

Then to add insult to injury, labelling them “residential schools” to try to project the actions of the U.S. & Canada onto China without regard for the actual historical and cultural contexts of the situations.  

Even the Dalai Lama recognizes Tibet as part of the PRC:

Much of western propaganda is projection, such as accusing China of “debt trap diplomacy” to deflect from the IMF using structural adjustment to entrap developing nations with debt and resource extraction.
