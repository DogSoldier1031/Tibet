Tried to sell this while showing the Tibetan language on the blackboard and a Tibetan dictionary:

That failed, so they tried facing a new photo downward…and the student’s shirts & textbooks show Tibetan on them:

So now they crop out the book and blur the school uniform badge to remove all evidence of Tibetans being taught in their own language:

The Renminbi note has multiple languages on it, including Chinese (phonetic), Tibetan, Uighur, Mongolian & Zhuang.

There are 56 recognized ethnic groups, most with their own autonomous regions.  Tibet is one.  Tibet’s population density is 3 people per square kilometer.  If not boarding school, how will a developing nation have a schooling system that covers those children?  A million tiny schools? Only home schooling in a developing region that is only now overcoming generational illiteracy?  If they were left uneducated that would be considered abuse too.  

Then to add insult to injury, labelling them “residential schools” to try to project the actions of the U.S. & Canada onto China without regard for the actual historical and cultural contexts of the situations.  

Even the Dalai Lama recognizes Tibet as part of the PRC:

Much of western propaganda is projection, such as accusing China of “debt trap diplomacy” to deflect from the IMF using structural adjustment to entrap developing nations with debt and resource extraction.
